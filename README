This is the `TreeViz` library, written by David Banas.

The intent of this library is to provide the data structures, type classes,
and support functions necessary for working with and visualizing computation
decomposition trees. For instance, the initial motivation for creating this
package was the need to visualize how data flow occurs in a fast Fourier
transform (FFT) of arbitrary radices and either decimation style (time or
frequency).
