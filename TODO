This is the TreeViz library "ToDo" list, listed in decreasing order of
priority:

1. Convert source to big boy Haskell, using Foldable, Traversable, etc.

2. Add the ability to track and classify operations performed, including
   keeping track of "trivial" twiddles and phasors.

3. Add more LogTree instances. (Scan, perhaps, and use the new capabilities,
   above, to show why it is reduceable to O(n)?)
