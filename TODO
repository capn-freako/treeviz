This is the TreeViz library "ToDo" list, listed in decreasing order of
priority:

- Convert source to big boy Haskell, using Foldable, Traversable, etc.
- Add the ability to track and classify operations performed, including
  keeping track of "trivial" twiddles and phasors.
- Add more LogTree instances. (Scan, perhaps, and use the new capabilities,
  above, to show why it is reduceable to O(n)?)
